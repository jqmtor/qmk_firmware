# jqmtor layout

The layout has a focus on improving the experience for someone coming from the Advantage 2.
An example of this is that the keys next to the spacebar, used for switching layers in the
default layout, are being used for enter and backspace instead.

This layout has the following objectives:

- Maximise of thumbs for common keystrokes
- Replicate key position from my Kinesis Advantage 2, as much as possible
- Have all modifier keys available on both sides of the keyboard, in symmetric position
- Have accents used in Portuguese available in Layer 0
- Have easy access to brackets, square brackets and parentheses, for programming
